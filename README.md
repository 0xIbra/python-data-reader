Data Reader
===========
> Python package that **lazily** reads data from large **JSON**, **XML** and **CSV** files.

Why not use the already existing libs you ask ?  
Well, for me, it was crucial to have a small package size that can be deployed to a **Serverless** environment as this was the main goal.  

Installation
------------
    pip install data-reader
